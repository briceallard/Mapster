## Description of Sprint
Brice assigned Vasudev and I to fix crashes on the ios version of the app. After trying a few fixes, we were able
to fix a button that wasn't working by moving a block of html out of a container. We spent a few hours trying to 
figure out why the edit picture button does not actually save the new picture, but could not figure out what was
causing the problem.
