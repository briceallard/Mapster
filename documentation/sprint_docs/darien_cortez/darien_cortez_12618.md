## Description of Sprint


Mackey and I helped Cory fix any errors he was having with getting the app on his laptop, and then we spent time
trying to figure out the best way to implement the side bar. We then altered my code for putting the 
menu on the navbar with the menu icon. We then formatted the sidebar menu, put content on the menu, and enabled the
buttons on the menu to navigate to other pages. All of our work was pushed by Cory.
