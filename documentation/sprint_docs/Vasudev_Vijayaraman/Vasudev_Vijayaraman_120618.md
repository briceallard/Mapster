## Description of Sprint
Brice assigned Zac and I to fix crashes on the ios version of the app. After trying a few fixes, we were able
to fix a button that wasn't working by moving a block of html out of a ion-container. We spent a few hours trying to 
figure out why the edit picture button does not actually save the new picture, but could not figure out what was
causing the problem. Threw some console logs on there to try to trace the problem but were not able to figure it out. 
Everything works well on iOS except the edit picture button that lets you crop an image.
